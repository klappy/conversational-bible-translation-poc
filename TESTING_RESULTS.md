# Testing Results - Oct 21, 2025

## What Was Tested

Testing was performed after applying fixes for:
- Documentation consolidation
- Backend `process is not defined` errors
- Orchestrator logic for calling Canvas Scribe
- Frontend cleanup

## Test Results

### ✅ WORKING:
1. **App builds successfully** - Zero compilation errors
2. **No linter errors** - Clean codebase
3. **Orchestrator calls Canvas Scribe** - Confirmed in logs
4. **Canvas Scribe returns JSON** - Now includes state updates in proper format
5. **Documentation is clean** - 33 docs → 12 organized docs

### ❌ STILL BROKEN:
1. **State persistence DOES NOT WORK** - Critical bug
   - Canvas Scribe returns: `{"message": "Noted!", "updates": {"styleGuide": {"conversationLanguage": "Japanese"}}, "summary": "..."}`
   - But state still shows: `"English"` instead of `"Japanese"`
   - The `updateCanvasState()` function is called but state doesn't change

## Server Log Evidence

From terminal logs (line 347-355, 384-390):
```
State response: Noted! 
{
  "updates": {
    "styleGuide": {
      "conversationLanguage": "Russian"
    }
  },
  "summary": "Conversation language set to Russian"
}
```

Canvas Scribe IS returning proper JSON now.

But when checking state afterward:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/canvas-state -H "X-Session-ID: test"
# Returns: "conversationLanguage": "English"  (unchanged!)
```

## Root Cause

The `updateCanvasState()` function in `conversation.js` is being called with the updates, but the canvas-state endpoint isn't actually applying them. Needs investigation into:

1. Is the POST to `/canvas-state/update` actually being made?
2. Is the update endpoint receiving the data?
3. Is the Netlify Blobs `.set()` call failing silently?

## Status: NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Do not deploy this code.** While it's cleaner and builds successfully, the core functionality (saving settings) is broken.

## Next Steps

1. Debug why `updateCanvasState()` isn't persisting
2. Add logging to canvas-state.js update handler
3. Test the update endpoint directly
4. Fix the persistence issue
5. Re-test end-to-end
6. ONLY THEN consider deployment

**Tested by:** Testing via curl commands
**Test Date:** October 21, 2025
**Verdict:** FAILS - State persistence broken
