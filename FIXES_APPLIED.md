# Fixes Applied - October 21, 2025

## Summary

Comprehensive audit and cleanup of the Bible Translation Assistant codebase, focusing on documentation consolidation and fixing critical runtime errors.

---

## Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation âœ…

### Problem

- 33 documentation files scattered across the repository
- Conflicting information between documents
- Test-specific docs mixed with core documentation
- No single source of truth

### Actions Taken

1. **Created Documentation Audit** (`DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md`)

   - Categorized all 33 documents
   - Identified conflicts and redundancies
   - Created migration plan

2. **Created Single Source of Truth** (`SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`)

   - Combined PRD vision with implementation reality
   - Documented 75% success rate honestly
   - Listed known issues and what works well
   - Included test results and insights

3. **Archived Outdated Documentation**

   - Moved 18+ docs to `docs/archive/`
   - Organized by category (debugging, test-results, old-guides)
   - Preserved history while cleaning workspace

4. **Cleaned Up Root Directory**
   - Deleted temporary log files
   - Removed redundant guides
   - Consolidated architecture docs

### Result

**Before:** 33 confusing, conflicting documents
**After:** 4 core docs + organized archive

- `README.md` - Setup and quick start
- `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Complete system spec (authoritative)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `docs/` - Focused, current documentation only

---

## Phase 2: Backend Critical Fixes âœ…

### Problem 1: `process is not defined` Errors

**Impact:** App would crash in production

#### Files Fixed:

1. **canvas-state.js**

   - Removed `process.env.SITE_ID` and `process.env.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - Now uses only `context.site.id` and `context.token`
   - Netlify provides these automatically in production

2. **conversation.js**

   - Removed global `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` initialization
   - Created OpenAI client per-request using `context.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Fixed `process.env.CONTEXT` assignment
   - Updated all `callAgent()` calls to pass `openaiClient` parameter
   - Changed internal URLs from `process.env.CONTEXT.url` to relative paths

3. **resources.js**
   - Replaced `process.cwd()` with proper path resolution using `import.meta.url`
   - Fixed file path construction for Netlify Functions environment
   - Removed unused `context` parameter

#### Code Changes:

```javascript
// BEFORE (would crash):
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// AFTER (works in Netlify):
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: context.env?.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
```

### Problem 2: Unused Parameter Warnings

- Removed unused `agentId` parameter from `updateState()`
- Removed unused `error` catch variable in conversation.js
- Removed unused `context` parameter from resources.js handler

**Result:** Zero `process is not defined` errors âœ…

---

## Phase 3: Orchestrator Logic Fixes âœ…

### Problem

Orchestrator wasn't calling Canvas Scribe (state manager) for short answers during planning phase, causing:

- Settings not being saved
- Repetition loops (asking for "Grade 3" six times)
- 25% failure rate in testing

### Solution

**Updated orchestrator system prompt** in `registry.js`:

#### Added Critical Rule:

```
ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RULE - ALWAYS CALL STATE AGENT IN PLANNING PHASE ðŸš¨

If workflow phase is "planning" AND user's message is short (under 50 characters):
â†’ ALWAYS include "state" agent!
```

#### Added Explicit Examples:

```javascript
User: "Spanish" (any language name)
Phase: planning
Response: {
  "agents": ["primary", "state"],
  "notes": "Short answer during planning = setting data."
}

User: "Grade 3" or "Grade 8" or any grade level
Phase: planning
Response: {
  "agents": ["primary", "state"],
  "notes": "Short answer during planning = reading level setting."
}
```

### Expected Impact

**Before:** 75% success rate (6/8 personas completed)
**After:** Expected 90%+ success rate (targeting 7-8/8 personas)

---

## Phase 4: Frontend Cleanup âœ…

### Problem

- Unused imports causing linter errors
- Missing React Hook dependencies causing warnings
- Code quality issues

### Actions Taken

1. **ChatInterfaceMultiAgent.jsx**
   - Removed unused `getSessionInfo` import
   - Removed unused `setMessages` destructure
   - Changed unused `error` catch variable to anonymous `catch {}`
   - Added `updateFromServerState` to useEffect dependency array

**Result:** Zero linter errors in frontend âœ…

---

## Phase 5: Documentation Updates âœ…

### README.md

- Updated to v0.4.1
- Added link to SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
- Split features into "Working âœ…" and "Planned ðŸš§"
- Added honest status: "75% success rate, improvements underway"

### SYSTEM_DESIGN.md (New!)

- Comprehensive system documentation
- Combines PRD vision with implementation reality
- Documents known issues transparently
- Includes test results and insights
- Serves as single source of truth

## Testing Status

### Ready to Test

All fixes are in place. The app should now:

1. âœ… Start without `process is not defined` errors
2. âœ… Call Canvas Scribe for all settings during planning
3. âœ… Save settings without repetition loops
4. âœ… Have zero linter errors
5. âœ… Have clean, organized documentation

### Next Steps for Testing

1. **Start the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev:netlify
   ```

2. **Test basic flow:**

   - Start conversation
   - Provide settings (one at a time: "Spanish", "Grade 3", etc.)
   - Verify Canvas Scribe says "Noted!" each time
   - Verify settings appear in Style Guide panel
   - Continue to Understanding phase
   - Complete Ruth 1:1 translation

3. **Check for issues:**
   - No repetition loops
   - Settings persist
   - Phase transitions work
   - Suggestions appear

### Success Criteria

- 90%+ completion rate (up from 75%)
- Zero `process` errors
- Settings save on first attempt
- No asking for same setting twice
