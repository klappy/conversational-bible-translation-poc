# Glossary Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Quick Responses Not Copy-Pasteable ✅
**Problem:** Buttons don't copy with conversation text  
**Solution:** Render as bullet list with `user-select: text`  
**Format:**
```
QUICK RESPONSES:
• Option 1
• Option 2
• Option 3
```
Now fully selectable and copy-pasteable.

### Issue 2: Glossary Panel Shows Nothing ✅
**Root Cause:** Mismatch between backend and frontend

**Backend saves:**
```javascript
{
  glossary: {
    keyTerms: { "judges": { definition: "...", verse: "Ruth 1:1" } },
    userPhrases: { "In the days...": "A time before kings..." }
  }
}
```

**Frontend was looking for:**
```javascript
project.glossary.terms // Wrong! Doesn't exist
```

**Fix:** Updated ScriptureCanvas.jsx to read from correct paths:
- `project.glossary.keyTerms` 
- `project.glossary.userPhrases`

**Now displays BOTH sections:**
1. "Your Phrase Translations" - What you said about each phrase
2. "Key Biblical Terms" - Biblical terms like judges, famine, etc.

### Issue 3: Delayed Suggestions ⚠️
**Problem:** Suggestions are for previous question  
**Cause:** Suggestion Helper doesn't have enough context about current question  
**Status:** Needs separate fix (Suggestion Helper prompt tuning)

## What You'll See Now

### Glossary Panel (During Understanding Phase):

```
Glossary
────────────────────

Your Phrase Translations
• In the days when the judges ruled
  → A time before the kings when some people made sure others followed the rules
  
• there was a famine in the land  
  → There was not enough time to eat
  
• So a man from Bethlehem in Judah
  → A man from the same town Jesus was born but way before Jesus came

Key Biblical Terms
• judges (Ruth 1:1)
  Leaders before kings who governed Israel
  
• Bethlehem (Ruth 1:1)
  Town in Judah, later birthplace of Jesus
```

## Testing Needed

After deployment refresh:
1. ✅ Can you select and copy the "QUICK RESPONSES:" section?
2. ✅ Does Glossary panel show "Your Phrase Translations"?
3. ✅ Does it list all 5 phrases you explained?
4. ⚠️ Are suggestions still delayed? (different fix needed)
