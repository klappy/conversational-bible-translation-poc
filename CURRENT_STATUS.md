# Current Status - Bible Translation Assistant

**Updated:** October 21, 2025 11:40 AM

## What's Working ✅

1. **Documentation is Clean**

   - 33 conflicting docs → 12 organized docs
   - Single source of truth: `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
   - 18+ docs archived with history preserved

2. **App Builds Successfully**

   - Zero compilation errors
   - Zero linter errors
   - All old/unused code removed

3. **Suggestion Helper Works**

   - Returns contextual suggestions
   - Appears inline in conversation
   - Examples: `["English", "Spanish", "Chinese"]`

4. **Orchestrator Fixed**

   - Correctly identifies short answers during planning
   - Calls Canvas Scribe for settings
   - Example: "Korean" → calls both primary + state agents

5. **Canvas Scribe Returns Proper JSON**

   - Format: `{"message": "Noted!", "updates": {...}, "summary": "..."}`
   - JSON extraction works
   - Logs show: "Applying state updates" ✅

6. **Update Endpoint Works**
   - Direct test: Saved "Turkish", "Finnish" successfully
   - Returns proper response with updated state
   - Status 200, no errors

## What's Still Broken ❌

### Critical Issue: State Persistence

**Problem:** Settings are not persisting after conversation flow

**Evidence:**

```bash
# Send "Korean" with session ID
curl -H "X-Session-ID: test" ... → Returns 200 OK

# Check state
curl -H "X-Session-ID: test" canvas-state → Shows "English" (unchanged!)
```

**What We Know:**

- ✅ Canvas Scribe is called
- ✅ Canvas Scribe returns correct JSON
- ✅ updateCanvasState() is called with correct data
- ✅ POST to /update returns 200 OK
- ❌ But querying state shows no change

**Possible Causes:**

1. Session ID not being passed through entire chain
2. State update saves to one session, query reads from another
3. Update works but merge isn't happening correctly
4. Netlify Blobs has timing issue

**Next Debug Steps:**

1. Add logging to show exactly which session is used for update vs query
2. Verify getCanvasState() at end of conversation uses same session as update
3. Check if Netlify Blobs is actually persisting or just returning in-memory

## Test Commands That Work

```bash
# Direct state update (WORKS)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/canvas-state/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Session-ID: test" \
  -d '{"updates": {"styleGuide": {"conversationLanguage": "Finnish"}}}'
# Returns: "success": true, conversationLanguage: "Finnish"

# Verify (WORKS)
curl http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/canvas-state -H "X-Session-ID: test"
# Returns: conversationLanguage: "Finnish"
```

## Test Commands That Fail

```bash
# Conversation flow (FAILS TO PERSIST)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/conversation \
  -H "X-Session-ID: test" \
  -d '{"message": "Korean", "history": [...]}'
# Canvas Scribe says "Noted!", update called, returns 200...

# But checking state (UNCHANGED)
curl http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/canvas-state -H "X-Session-ID: test"
# Returns: conversationLanguage: "English" (default, not Korean!)
```

## Files Modified Today

### Backend

- `netlify/functions/conversation.js` - Fixed process errors, added Suggestion Helper, session IDs
- `netlify/functions/canvas-state.js` - Fixed process errors
- `netlify/functions/resources.js` - Fixed process.cwd()
- `netlify/functions/agents/registry.js` - Enhanced orchestrator rules, Canvas Scribe JSON format

### Frontend

- `src/components/ChatInterfaceMultiAgent.jsx` - Removed unused code, fixed dependencies
- `src/components/MobileSwipeView.jsx` - Updated to use ChatInterfaceMultiAgent
- Deleted: `ChatInterface.jsx`, `QuickSuggestions.jsx`, `ResponseProcessor.js`, `TranslationWorkflow.js`

### Documentation

- Created: `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md`, `FIXES_APPLIED.md`, `TESTING_RESULTS.md`
- Archived: 18+ documents to `docs/archive/`
- Updated: `README.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Debug session ID flow** - Why does update save to one place, query reads from another?
2. **Add comprehensive logging** - Track session ID through entire chain
3. **Fix the persistence bug** - This is the core 25% failure cause
4. **Test end-to-end** - Full conversation flow with state verification
5. **ONLY THEN** consider deployment

## DO NOT DEPLOY

The app looks clean, builds successfully, and many components work - but **the core functionality (saving settings) is broken**. Deploying now would just create a broken production system.

**Honest Assessment:** We made good progress on cleanup but haven't fixed the core bug yet.
**Time Invested:** ~3 hours
**Status:** Work in progress, needs more debugging
