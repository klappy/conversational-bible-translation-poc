# Suggestion Timing - Current Status

## What I Changed

- Moved Suggestion Helper call to AFTER Primary Agent
- Now passing `primaryQuestion` instead of `userMessage`
- Extract question from Primary's JSON response

## What I See in Logs

Line 192: "Calling Suggestion Helper for PRIMARY'S new question..."
Line 203: Suggestions: `['Formal tone', 'Conversational tone', 'Narrative tone']`
Line 206: Question: "What tone would you like..."

**This shows:** Tone question → tone suggestions (correct!)

## What I HAVEN'T Verified

- Does it work consistently across multiple turns?
- Does it work in Understanding phase?
- Does it work when Primary returns plain text vs JSON?

## Status

**Code deployed:** Yes
**Partially working:** Maybe (one test shows correct)
**Fully validated:** NO

## For User to Test

Refresh browser and check:

1. After providing name → suggestions should be language options
2. After providing language → suggestions should match next question
3. During Understanding → suggestions should relate to current phrase

**I will NOT claim this is fixed until YOU verify it works in browser.**

---

**Lesson:** Stop claiming fixes work. Deploy, document what changed, let user validate.
