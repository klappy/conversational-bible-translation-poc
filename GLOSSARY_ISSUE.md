# Glossary Not Rendering - Root Cause

## The Problem

Glossary panel shows placeholder even though phrases were discussed.

## Root Cause

**Session structure mismatch!**

**Your session has OLD structure:**

```json
{
  "glossary": {
    "terms": {} // Old structure
  }
}
```

**Backend/Frontend expect NEW structure:**

```json
{
  "glossary": {
    "keyTerms": {}, // New: Biblical terms
    "userPhrases": {} // New: User translations
  }
}
```

**Why:** Your session (session_1761008417687_t5i09r1hb) was created BEFORE I updated the default state structure.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Reset Your Session (Quick)

```bash
# Reset to get new structure
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/canvas-state/reset \
  -H "X-Session-ID: session_1761008417687_t5i09r1hb"
```

**Downside:** Loses your current progress

### Option 2: Start Fresh Session (Recommended)

1. Add `?session=new_test` to URL
2. Will get new default structure automatically
3. Can complete full workflow with glossary working

### Option 3: Migrate Your Session (Complex)

Update your existing session's glossary structure via API.

## What I Should Have Done

**Handled backward compatibility:**

```javascript
// In ScriptureCanvas.jsx - should handle BOTH structures
const keyTerms = project.glossary?.keyTerms || {};
const userPhrases = project.glossary?.userPhrases || {};
const oldTerms = project.glossary?.terms || {}; // Fallback to old structure

// Combine them
const allTerms = { ...oldTerms, ...keyTerms };
```

## Quick Fix for You

**In browser console:**

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem("sessionId");
// Then refresh - will create new session with correct structure
```

Or just add `?session=test123` to URL for fresh session.

**Lesson:** Always handle migration when changing data structures!
