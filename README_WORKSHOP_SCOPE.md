# Bible Translation Workshop - Current Scope & Limitations

## ✅ What This Workshop CAN Do

This workshop is a **proof of concept** for conversational Bible translation, specifically designed for:

- **Ruth 1:1 (first verse only)**
- Single verse translation workflow
- English source text (Berean Standard Bible)
- 5 specific phrases from Ruth 1:1
- Complete translation process: Settings → Understanding → Drafting → Checking

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### Single Verse Only

- **Optimized for Ruth 1:1 only**
- Moving to verse 2 or other passages will cause issues
- Phrase recognition is hardcoded to Ruth 1:1's specific phrases
- Cannot dynamically handle different verses yet

### Workaround for Multiple Verses

If you want to translate additional verses:

1. Complete Ruth 1:1 fully (through checking phase)
2. Save/export your translation
3. Refresh the browser to start a new session
4. Manually repeat for the next verse

### Known Issues Being Addressed

- Occasional infinite loops in phrase exploration (Process Monitor helps detect)
- Glossary mapping sometimes saves incorrectly (being validated now)
- Phase transitions sometimes don't display properly

## 🚀 What's Coming Next

### Short Term (Next Sprint)

- **Process Monitor** - Self-correcting system that fixes data issues automatically
- Better loop detection and recovery
- Improved glossary validation

### Long Term (Future Release)

- **Dynamic verse handling** - Work with any Bible passage
- **Multi-verse workflows** - Translate entire chapters continuously
- **Flexible phrase extraction** - No hardcoded phrase lists
- **Cross-reference support** - Handle parallel passages

## 📝 For Beta Testers

Please be aware:

- This is a **proof of concept** focused on demonstrating the conversational approach
- Best experience is with Ruth 1:1 only
- Other verses may work partially but aren't officially supported
- Your feedback on the core workflow is most valuable

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

Despite current limitations, this workshop demonstrates:

- Natural conversation-based translation
- Collaborative AI agents with specific roles
- User-driven understanding and interpretation
- Quality checking and validation
- Accessible translation for non-experts

## 📧 Feedback

If you encounter issues or have suggestions:

- Note which verse you were working on
- Describe where in the process you got stuck
- Share what you were trying to accomplish

Remember: This is a learning prototype, not a production system. The goal is to explore and refine the conversational translation approach.
