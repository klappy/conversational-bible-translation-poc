- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] `.gitignore` configured properly
- [x] Netlify configuration (`netlify.toml`) present
- [x] Netlify CLI installed and authenticated
- [x] All changes committed to git

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: GitHub Repository üöÄ

**Status**: Ready to create

**Action Required**:

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Create repository named: `conversational-bible-translation-poc`
3. Set visibility (Public/Private)
4. **DO NOT initialize with any files**
5. After creation, run in terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/conversational-bible-translation-poc.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Phase 2: Netlify Deployment üåê

**Two Options Available**:

#### Option A: Web UI (Easier)

- [ ] Go to https://app.netlify.com
- [ ] Import from GitHub
- [ ] Configure build settings
- [ ] Add OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- [ ] Deploy

#### Option B: CLI (Faster)

```bash
# Run these commands:
netlify init
# Choose: Create & configure a new site
# Select team: unfoldingWord or klappy
# Choose site name or leave blank

# Deploy immediately
netlify deploy --prod

# Set environment variable
netlify env:set OPENAI_API_KEY "your_key_here"
```
