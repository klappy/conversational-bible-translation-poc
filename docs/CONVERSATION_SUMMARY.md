# Conversation Summary - Building the Bible Translation PoC

## Initial Context

The user presented a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an AI-Augmented Bible Translation Assistant, designed for demonstration at the ETEN Summit (November 2025). The goal was to build a conversational tool that guides users through Bible translation using the FIA methodology.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Technology Choices

- **LLM**: GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective, sufficient for PoC)
- **Frontend**: React (over Svelte due to better chat UI resources)
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (serverless, user's preference)
- **Bible Text**: Berean Standard Bible (open license CC BY-SA 4.0)
- **Mobile UI**: Swipeable cards for mobile, sidebar for desktop

### 2. Scope Decisions

- Start with Ruth 1:1-5 for demo, expandable to full chapter
- Mock audio features for initial PoC
- Use local JSON files for Bible and resource data
- Implement all 6 FIA workflow phases

### 3. Design Approach

- Mobile-first with responsive breakpoint at 768px
- Swipeable cards on mobile (like Tinder for Bible verses)
- Collapsible sidebar on desktop (70/30 split)
- Four main artifacts: Style Guide, Glossary, Scripture Canvas, Feedback

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup

1. Initialized React app with Vite (faster than Create React App)
2. Set up Netlify Functions structure
3. Configured PWA manifest for installability
4. Created environment variable templates

### Phase 2: Core Components Built

1. **ChatInterface**: Main conversational UI with streaming
2. **ScriptureCanvas**: Desktop sidebar with 4 tabbed sections
3. **MobileSwipeView**: Swipeable card interface for mobile
4. **TranslationContext**: Global state management
5. **TranslationWorkflow**: FIA methodology engine

### Phase 3: Backend Implementation

1. **chat.js**: OpenAI integration with streaming responses
2. **resources.js**: Serve Bible text and FIA resources
3. System prompt injection for guided conversation
4. CORS configuration for API access

### Phase 4: Data Structure

1. BSB Ruth Chapter 1 with phrase breakdown
2. Default glossary of biblical terms
3. Mock structure for FIA resources
4. Placeholder for unfoldingWord materials

## Recent Updates (October 17, 2025)

### v0.1.0 - Fixed FIA Workflow Issues

The user identified that the translation workflow was not following proper FIA methodology:

- Was asking about themes/meaning before showing verse text
- Questions were thematic instead of comprehension-based
- Missing phrase-by-phrase progression

**Fixes Implemented:**

1. Updated system prompt with comprehensive FIA methodology
2. Enhanced workflow to present verse text BEFORE questions
3. Changed question generation to focus on comprehension
4. Added proper phrase-by-phrase tracking through verses
5. Improved context passing to AI with current phrase and progress

The application now correctly follows the FIA pattern:

- **Planning**: Confirm settings
- **Understanding**: Show verse ‚Üí Ask comprehension ‚Üí Collect user phrasing
- **Drafting**: Synthesize user input into translation

---

### v0.2.0 - Canvas Integration Fixed

The user identified that canvas artifacts weren't updating during conversation:

- Conversation was happening but nothing saved to Style Guide, Glossary, or Scripture Canvas
- Complete disconnect between chat and artifact panels

**Solution Implemented:**

1. Created ResponseProcessor service to parse AI responses
2. Added automatic state updates when AI mentions changes
3. Implemented user articulation capture during Understanding phase
4. Added structured updates from backend for reliable state sync
5. Connected all canvas components to properly reflect conversation state

The application now properly synchronizes:

- Style Guide updates when settings are confirmed
- Glossary populates with terms discussed
- Scripture Canvas shows original text and drafts
- User articulations are captured and stored

### v0.3.0 - Multi-Agent Architecture

The user wanted a more antifragile, scalable approach using multiple specialized agents instead of fragile client-side parsing.

**Key Requirements:**

- Server-side state management
- Multiple LLMs working together
- Visual identity for each agent
- Checks and balances between agents
- Easy to add new agents without breaking existing ones

**Solution Implemented:**

1. Created multi-agent system with 5 specialized agents
2. Each agent has discrete responsibilities and system prompts
3. Server-side canvas state management (in-memory for now)
4. Visual identity system with icons and colors
5. Agent status panel showing active team members
6. Polling mechanism for state synchronization
7. Fallback to original chat if multi-agent fails

**Agent Team:**

- **Orchestrator** (üé≠ Purple): Manages conversation flow
- **Primary Translator** (üìñ Blue): Handles FIA methodology
- **State Manager** (üìù Green): Extracts and saves state
- **Validator** (‚úÖ Orange): Quality control
- **Resource Agent** (üìö Indigo): Biblical resources

The system is now antifragile - agents can fail independently, new agents can be added easily, and the conversation continues naturally while state management happens in the background.

## Session 5: Agent Behavior Refinement (October 20, 2025)

### Major Issues Resolved

#### 1. Canvas Scribe Behavior
- **Problem**: Canvas Scribe was asking questions, repeating messages, and providing summaries
- **Solution**: Aggressively updated system prompt with explicit "YOU NEVER ASK QUESTIONS!" rules
- **Result**: Scribe now only acknowledges and records data silently

#### 2. Translation Assistant Question Order  
- **Problem**: Not following the prescribed 7-step customization order, asking duplicate questions
- **Solution**: Added `MANDATORY ORDER FOR CUSTOMIZATION` with explicit sequence enforcement
- **Result**: Consistent, logical flow through customization process

#### 3. JSON Output in Understanding Phase
- **Problem**: Translation Assistant reverting to plain text instead of JSON format
- **Solution**: Added aggressive warnings and checklists directly in prompts
- **Result**: Reliable JSON output with proper suggestions

#### 4. UI Panel Synchronization
- **Problem**: Canvas panels not switching when phase changes
- **Solution**: Fixed React component state subscriptions to workflow.currentPhase
- **Result**: Panels automatically switch to relevant tab based on workflow phase

#### 5. Conversation History Context
- **Problem**: LLMs receiving malformed conversation history
- **Solution**: Refactored to structured message array format with role/content pairs
- **Result**: Better context awareness and reduced duplicate questions

### Architecture Improvements

- **State Management**: Improved context-aware recording in Canvas Scribe
- **Phase Transitions**: Clear rules for when to move between workflow phases  
- **Message Filtering**: Remove empty Resource Librarian responses
- **Mobile Experience**: Cards reorder based on active workflow phase
- **Rich Formatting**: Added bold, italics, and markdown for better readability

### Current Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**: 7-step customization in strict order
2. **Understanding Phase**: Systematic phrase-by-phrase scripture understanding
3. **Drafting Phase**: Translation work with collected context
4. **Checking Phase**: Quality assurance and validation
5. **Sharing Phase**: Community feedback collection
6. **Publishing Phase**: Final output generation

The system now provides a natural, conversational flow with proper state management, accurate phase tracking, and responsive UI updates.
