# Conversation Summary - Building the Bible Translation PoC

## Initial Context

The user presented a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an AI-Augmented Bible Translation Assistant, designed for demonstration at the ETEN Summit (November 2025). The goal was to build a conversational tool that guides users through Bible translation using the FIA methodology.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Technology Choices

- **LLM**: GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective, sufficient for PoC)
- **Frontend**: React (over Svelte due to better chat UI resources)
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (serverless, user's preference)
- **Bible Text**: Berean Standard Bible (open license CC BY-SA 4.0)
- **Mobile UI**: Swipeable cards for mobile, sidebar for desktop

### 2. Scope Decisions

- Start with Ruth 1:1-5 for demo, expandable to full chapter
- Mock audio features for initial PoC
- Use local JSON files for Bible and resource data
- Implement all 6 FIA workflow phases

### 3. Design Approach

- Mobile-first with responsive breakpoint at 768px
- Swipeable cards on mobile (like Tinder for Bible verses)
- Collapsible sidebar on desktop (70/30 split)
- Four main artifacts: Style Guide, Glossary, Scripture Canvas, Feedback

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup

1. Initialized React app with Vite (faster than Create React App)
2. Set up Netlify Functions structure
3. Configured PWA manifest for installability
4. Created environment variable templates

### Phase 2: Core Components Built

1. **ChatInterface**: Main conversational UI with streaming
2. **ScriptureCanvas**: Desktop sidebar with 4 tabbed sections
3. **MobileSwipeView**: Swipeable card interface for mobile
4. **TranslationContext**: Global state management
5. **TranslationWorkflow**: FIA methodology engine

### Phase 3: Backend Implementation

1. **chat.js**: OpenAI integration with streaming responses
2. **resources.js**: Serve Bible text and FIA resources
3. System prompt injection for guided conversation
4. CORS configuration for API access

### Phase 4: Data Structure

1. BSB Ruth Chapter 1 with phrase breakdown
2. Default glossary of biblical terms
3. Mock structure for FIA resources
4. Placeholder for unfoldingWord materials

## Features Implemented

### Working Features

- âœ… Conversational chat with AI assistant
- âœ… Responsive design (mobile/desktop)
- âœ… Swipeable cards on mobile
- âœ… Collapsible sidebar on desktop
- âœ… 4 artifact panels (Style Guide, Glossary, Scripture, Feedback)
- âœ… FIA workflow state machine
- âœ… Streaming chat responses
- âœ… Mock audio recording UI
- âœ… PWA manifest for installability

```

## Unique Design Elements

### Mobile Experience

- Swipe horizontally between cards (Chat, Style Guide, Glossary, Scripture, Feedback)
- Swipe up to dismiss temporary resource cards
- Instagram-style dots for navigation indication
- Touch-optimized interface

### Desktop Experience

- Traditional sidebar layout
- Tabbed navigation for artifacts
- Resizable panels
- Keyboard-friendly interface

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Responsive Design**: Solved with conditional rendering based on viewport
2. **Streaming Responses**: Implemented SSE for real-time chat
3. **State Management**: Used Context API for simplicity
4. **Mock Data**: Created comprehensive mock Bible and glossary data
5. **PWA Requirements**: Added manifest and meta tags

## Testing Approach

The app was built iteratively with:

- Build verification (`npm run build`)
- Linting checks passed
- Manual testing of responsive breakpoints
- Mock data validation

## Deployment Readiness

### What's Ready

- Complete React application
- Netlify Functions configured
- Build process verified
- Environment variable structure
- PWA manifest
- Documentation

### What's Needed for Deployment

1. Create `.env` file with OpenAI API key
2. Push to GitHub repository
3. Connect to Netlify
4. Configure environment variables in Netlify
5. Deploy

## Workshop Demo Paths

### Path 1: Quick Demo (10 min)

- Single verse (Ruth 1:1)
- Show planning and understanding phases
- Demonstrate mobile swipe interface

### Path 2: Standard Demo (30 min)

- All features demonstration
- Q&A session

## Next Steps Identified

### Immediate

1. Add `.env` file with API keys
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Deploy to Netlify
4. Test with real OpenAI API

### Future Enhancements

- Real audio with Whisper API

## Key Quotes from Development

- "It's like Tinder but for Bible translation"
- "Swipe left on Leviticus, I guess"
- "A minimum viable prophet"
- "Like having both a spoon AND a fork instead of trying to eat soup with chopsticks"

## Summary

Successfully built a functional PoC that demonstrates:

- AI-guided Bible translation workflow
- Responsive, modern UI
- FIA methodology implementation
- Serverless architecture
- Ready for ETEN Summit demonstration

The app provides a solid foundation for church-based Bible translation, making the process accessible through conversational AI while maintaining theological accuracy through structured workflows.
